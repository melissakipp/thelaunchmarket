Current Frontend issues:
- NGINX is displaying 500 error
  *** I think NGINX is port is for production... because I can see the sign in the dev port 3000
    - The instructor goes to localhost to see his site...
- rspec is finding test files and able to run the test but is failing. I believe the issue is that I am not pointing to the right port...
  *** I am almost positive that there is no real reason to use rspec because in the end I will be using Jest
    - Will be removing rspec from final files
- Selenium is available on port 4444
  *** Issue: "Whoops! The URL specified routes to this help page."
      - ON HOLD
- Terraform
  *** Issue: cannot get Terraform into a Docker container...
- Work on making the image(s) smaller
